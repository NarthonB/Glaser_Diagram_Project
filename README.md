The purpose of this project is to visually and quantitatively show the points of condensation in a user-defined wall.

All data and equations were taken from the Applied Thermodynamics course taken at INSA Strasbourg (cited below).
Some early versions might have some language inconsistencies since this course was taught in french.

Version 0.1: The most basic possible version of the code.
- Includes most of the relevant calculations required to get a temperature (and therefore pressure) evolution across the wall
- Returns all relevant evolutions on the same axis
- No user input - pre-designed wall


Version 1: Fully functional code with little to no extra functionalities.

  v1.0: Most simple version which still outputs the desired output.
  - allows user to customize a wall of (maximum 3) layers by their materials and thickness
  - returns a plot with a temperature and a pressure y-axis, which highlights where condensation occurs

  v1.1: More organised version.
  - use of arrays rather than variable names to shorten code and make it easier to add layers in the future 
  - clearly commented blocks of code
  - improved variable names

  v1.2: Layer Properties and Internal/External Conditions assigned to DataFrames.
  - Clearer to differentiate constant and manipulated variables.
  - CONCERN: While more organised, lines of code are much more long-winded. Could make code visually harder to understand.

  v1.3: 
  - reorganised code, some variable name changes and improved commenting
  - defined equations separately from the main code
  - changed layers dataframe
  - added a function to find condensation point(s)
  - added convection coefficient equation depending on terms of air speed

v1.4:
  - condensed all final data into a dataframe
  - changed plotting function to take df and layer bounds as input (hopefully make this part of df in future)
  - Add vapour barrier
    - changed vapour flow equation to include addition of a VB
  - changed equation for checking layer (not sure why/how it worked before)
  - reduced number of variables
  - created a separate rounding function
  - Improved plot display
    - created a colour-picking function to clarify different materials
    - made separations clearer
  - Reorganised some code

  v1.?: (list of planned features to be added during the v1 phase)
  - will integrate a choice of a permeable coating to mitigate condensation
  - will improve the visualisation with labels and/or textures for different materials
  - improve the LayerData file to make the types of material clearer
  - improve user interface


Version 2 (Future version): will build upon the most updated v1; adding extra functionalities to base code
- use of the 'Meteostat_import_station_data' function included in the project files to be able to determine the validity of the model for different parts of the year for a given location in the world
- estimate how the materials will be affected by the condensation over time
- cost analysis
- try and integrate acoustics?
